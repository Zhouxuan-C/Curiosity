```
typically ad.一般 通常		inch n.英寸		generation n.一代		apparently ad.开样子 似乎

In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

```
increase n.增长		appear v.出现 似乎 显得		increasingly ad.越来越多地		
practice n.通常地做法		recruiting v.招募 招聘 征兵	
至于 NBA 球员，他们身高的增长似乎是从世界各地招募运动员这种日益普遍做法的结果。

nutrient n.营养物质		notably ad.(用于举例)尤其 特别		protein n.蛋白质	 feed v.满足需要

Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height—5'9" for men, 5'4" for women—hasn’t really changed since 1960.

```
yet 然而 仍然		prevention n.预防 		since ad.此后 自从

organism n.生物体 有机体		
西北大学的人类学家 William Leonard 说：的确有一些由生物个体的基因结构所设定的身高限制。

Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. 

```
maximum n.最大量		expect v.指望	
基因设置的最高身高可能会改变，但别指望它很快就发生。

Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration.

She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. 

```
military a.军队的
她说，与篮球队服不同，军服的长度已经很久没有改动过了。
```



And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, “you could use today's data and feel fairly confident.”

```
predict v.预测		piece n.块 片 件		equipment n.设备 装备		fairly ad.相当
confident a.有把握的		by and large 总的说来 大体上
