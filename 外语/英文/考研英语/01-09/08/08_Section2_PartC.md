### Part C



In his autobiography，Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with extraordinary modesty. 

```
autobiography n.自传		intellectual a.智力的		extraordinary a.特大的 特多的
modesty n.谦虚
达尔文在他的自传里，特别谦虚地谈到了自己的智力。
```



He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in expressing himself clearly and concisely, but **he believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations.**

```
point out sth 指出... 	 difficulty n.困难 	   express v.表达 	   concisely ad.简洁地
compensate v.弥补 补偿		advantage n.优势 优点 	 forcing n.强制 促成	intently ad.专注地
enable 使能够			detect v.发现 察觉		reasoning n.推理 论证		observations n.观察
他指出，他总是很难清晰简洁地表达自己，但他认为或许正是因为这种困难，他迫使自己对要说的每句话都经过长时间的思考，从而能够发现自己在推理和观察中的错误，结果这反而成为他的优点。
```



He disclaimed the possession of any great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished Huxley.

```
disclaim v.公开否认		possession n.具有		quickness n.机敏		apprehension n.理解 领悟
wit n.智力		distinguished a.杰出的
他不认为自己像卓尔不群的 Huxley 那样，具有敏锐的理解力或者智力。
```



**He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics.** 

```
assert v.坚持认为 		purely ad.纯粹地 完全	 train of thought 思路  		felt == feel
mathematics n.数学
他还坚持认为，他自己进行长时间纯抽象思维的能力十分有限，由此，他认定自己在数学方面不可能有大的作为。
```



His memory, too, he described as extensive, but hazy. 

```
extensive a.广博的 广泛的			hazy a.记不清的 模糊的
他还声称自己的记忆力虽然广博却不精准。
```



So poor in one sense was it that he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or a line of poetry.

```
sense n.意义 看待...的角度			date n.会晤		poetry n.诗歌
在某种意义上，他的记忆力如此之差，以至于他对单次会晤或一行诗歌的记忆从不会超过几天。
```



**On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of reasoning.**

```
accept v.相信(某事属实) 认为 接受			well founded a.有充分根据的		charge n.指责 谴责
critic n.批评者		observer n.观察者			reasoning n.推理
另一方面，某些他的批评者谴责他虽然善于观察，却不具备推理能力，而他认为这种说法缺乏充分根据。
```



This, he thought, could not be true, because the “Origin of Species” is one long argument from the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. 

```
species n.物种		argument n.论证		convince v.使信服		able a.有才智的 有才能的
他认为，这不可能是事实，因为《物种起源》从头至尾就是一个长篇论证，而且它令很多有才能的人信服。
```



No one, he submits, could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. 

```
submit v.认为 主张		possess v.有 拥有
他认为能写出这样一本书的人必定具备一定的推理能力。
```



He was willing to assert that “I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher degree.” 

```
fair a.尚可的			invention n.发明			common sense 常识			judgment n.判断力
fairly ad.尚 还		degree n.程度
他欣然宣称：“我的创造力以及常识或者判断力的水平尚可，正如每一位比较成功的律师或医生都应该具备的那样，不过我觉得自己没有更高的水平”。
```



**He adds humbly that perhaps he was “superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.”**

```
humbly ad.谦逊地		superior a.更胜一筹的		run n.普通类型的人(或物品)	
escape v.被忽视 逃跑			attention n.注意 留心		observe v.观察
他又自谦地说，或许自己“在注意到容易被忽视的事物，并对其仔细观察方面优于常人”。
```



Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that in two or three respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. 

```
opinion n.观点 主张			respect n.(事物的)方面 细节 		preceding a.之前发生的	
在生命的最后一年里，达尔文在写作中表达了如下观点：在过去的二三十年里，他的心智在两三个方面发生变化。
```



Up to the age of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. 

```
up to sth 达到(某数) 至多有		beyond 晚于 迟于		pleasure n.愉快 高兴
一直到 30 岁或者晚些时候，各种诗歌还能给他带来很多快乐。
```



Formerly, too, pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. 

```
formerly ad.以前		considerable a.相当大的		delight n.高兴
而且，以前绘画、音乐都会使他相当开心。
```



In 1881, however, he said: “Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. 

```
endure 忍耐 耐心
然而在 1881 年，他却说：“如今我已经多年都没有耐心去读一行诗了”。
```



I have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music.” 

```
taste n.爱好
我对绘画和音乐的兴趣也丧失殆尽了。
```



**Darwin was convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character.**

```
convinced a.坚信的			injurious a.造成伤害的		intellect n.智力的		 moral a.道德的
character n.品质 品格
达尔文确信，没有了这些爱好不只是少了乐趣，而且可能有损于一个人的思维能力，更有可能导致道德品质下降。
```
