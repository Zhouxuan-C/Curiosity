### Part B



The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing almost anything else instead of writing
has ended. 

```

lie v.躺下 说谎 n.谎言
只有你不再逃避这件非做不可的事，并坐着、站着或躺着写，初稿才能出现在纸上。

语法、标点和拼写可以等到修改时再考虑。
```



Concentrate on what you are saying.

Good writing most often occurs when you are in hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a nervous search for errors.

```

```
printout n.打印件		revision n.修订本 修正

一旦完成了书面初稿，你就可以删除与论题无关的内容，添加必要的材料来阐明观点并使文章更具说服力。

```
have nothing to do with sb/sth 与...毫不相干			explain 说明		influence 影响
setting n.背景 环境			
尽管这是一个有趣的话题，但它与“解释背景环境如何影响 Sammy 做出辞职决定”这一论题无官。
```



**Instead of including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel’s crabbed response to the girls so that she could lead up to the A & P “policy” he enforces.**

```
crabbed a.(脾气)暴躁的		lead up to sth 渐渐引入			enforce v.(强制)执行 实施

```



Remember that your initial draft is only that.

```



The sentences within each paragraph should be related to a single topic.

```
[A] To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so that you can easily add words, sentences and corrections. Write on only one side of the paper.


[B] After you have already and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay particular attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It’s probably best to write the introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. Concluding paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with a final impression.


[C] It’s worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer may look terrible, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have gone into it. Many writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages each time they finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other problems.


[D] It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have developed a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out whatever outline you have made.


[E] Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which explains how the setting influences Sammy’s decision to quit his job. Instead of including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel’s crabbed response to the girls so that she could lead up to the A & P “policy” he enforces.


[F] In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting in “A&P” the student brings together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal to accept Lengel’s store policies.


[G] By using the first draft as a means of thinking about what you want to say, you will very likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of good writers don’t use outlines at all but discover ordering principles as they write. Do not attempt to compose a perfectly correct draft the first time around.
