If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months.

如果查看2006年世界杯每个足球运动员的出生证明，你可能发现一个值得注意的奇事：精锐的足球运动员很可能出生于一年中的头几个月而非后几个月。

If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.

如果继续查看为世界杯和职业球队输送人才的欧洲国家青年队，你会发现这个奇怪的现象甚至更加明显。

What might account for this strange phenomenon? 



Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.
