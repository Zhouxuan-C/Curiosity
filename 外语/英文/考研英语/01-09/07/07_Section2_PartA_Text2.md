For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column called “Ask Marilyn.” 

```
supplement n.(报纸的)增刊	Parade n.《大观》(《华盛顿邮报》的周末增刊)		feature v.以...为特色
column n.(报刊的)专栏
在过去的几年中，报纸周日增刊《大观》开设了一版名为“问问玛丽莲”的特色专栏。
```



People are invited to query Marilyn Vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 – the highest score ever recorded. 

```
invite v.邀请		mental a.智力的	ever ad.以往任何时候		record v.记录
人们受邀向玛丽莲提问，她在10岁时测得智力水平相当于普通人23岁左右得水平，也就是智商为228-这是有记录以来的最高分数。
```



IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. 

```
verbal a.语言的	visual a.视觉的	analogy n.类比 模拟 类推	envision v.想象  deduce v.推理 
similar a.类似的   numerical a.数字的	 sequence n.序列 数列  	among 在...当中	fold v.折叠
IQ测试要求你完成语言和视觉的类推、想象纸张经折叠和剪切后的形状、推导数列，以及其他类似的任务。
```



So it is a bit confusing when Vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? 

```
confusing a.难以理解的	field v.处理 应付	average Joe 普通人 	fondness n.喜爱
nature n.基本特征		coincidence n.巧合
因此，莎凡特能巧妙应对普通人（智商为100）提出的诸如：“爱和喜爱的区别”、“幸运和巧合的本质是什么？”这类问题，这有点令人费解。
```



It’ s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.

```
obvious a.显然	capacity n.能力 容量	visualize v.想象		figure out 计算出
pattern n.模式	suit v.使适合		elude v.难倒		poet n.诗人	philosopher n.哲学家
想象物体和破解数值模式的能力如何使人解答那些曾难倒一些优秀诗人和哲学家的问题，这一点难以理解。
```



Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test.

```
intelligence n.智力	encompasses v.包含
显然，智力不仅仅涉及在某项测试中获得的某个分数。
```



Just what does it mean to be smart?

```
mean v.通常被认为是	smart a.聪明的
究竟什么通常被认为是聪明呢？
```



How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

```
specify v.明确 详细说明	neurology n.神经(病)学		genetics n.遗传学		field n.领域 田
智力有多大比例可以被明确测知？我们从神经学、遗传学、计算机科学和其他领域又能对智力了解多少呢？
```



The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. 

```
define v.给...下定义 	term n.术语
尽管IQ测试已经不像以前那样频繁使用，但IQ分数似乎仍然是定义人类智力的术语。
```



The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’ s version). 

```
come v.被采用 可用 有		primarily ad.主要地	scale n.秤 刻度 
IQ测试主要有两种形式，斯坦福-比奈智力测量表和威克斯勒智力测量表（二者都有成人和儿童版）
```



Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. 

```
generally ad.通常地	costing n.成本估算		several ad.一些		psychologist n.心理学家
variation n.变体 改编版本		populate v.充满 出现于		World Wide Web 万维网 互联网
这两种形式的测试通常花费数百美元，且一般只由心理学家提供，不过他们的改编版在书店和互联网随处可见。
```



Superhigh scores like Vos Savant’ s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. 

```
superhigh a.极高 相当高		statistical a.统计的 统计学的 		distribution n.分布 分配
peer n.同龄人	 	rather than 而不是		divide v.除以		mental a.思想的 精神的
chronological a.按年代顺序排列		multiply v.乘
像帆沙特那样的超高分数不可能再出现，因为现在的打分是以同龄群体在统计学意义上的人口分布为基础的，而不是简单地用心理年龄除以生理年龄再乘以100。
```



Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.

```
standardize v.使标准化		scholastic a.学校的 学业的	assessment n.评定  graduate n.毕业生
capture v.(用文字、图片)正确记录 充分体现(某种观点)		aspect n.放面 特点
其他标准化测试，比如学术评估测验（SAT）和研究生入学考试（GRE），都充分体现了IQ测试的主要特点。
```



Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. 

```
assess v.评估 估算		element n.要素		necessary a.必需的		argue v.论证 说理
罗伯特认为，像这种标准化的测试也许不能评估在学业和生活中取得成功所必需的所有重要因素。
```



In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. 

```
note v.指出		traditional a.传统的	 	best ad.最  		analytical a.分析的 	
measure v.估量		creativity n.创造力   		practical a.实践的 实际的
component n.组成部分 因素  		solve v.解决 		critical a.极重要的 关键的
斯特恩伯在他的文章《智力测试有多智能？》中指出，传统测试能够对分析能力和语言能力做出最佳评估，但是难以估量创造力和实践知识，而这两个因素对于解决问题和生活中取得成功也至关重要。
```



Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. 

```
moreover ad.此外 而且		necessarily ad.必然地	 once ad.一次 conj.一旦  	predict v.预测
population n.群体 人口		 situations n.情况 环境
此外，一旦受试群体或环境发生改变，IQ测试不一定能做出准确预测。
```



Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership – that is, it predicted the opposite. 

```
leadership n.领导能力 领导人员		condition n.条件 环境		correlate v.和...相关
be negatively/positively correlated with ... 与...负/正相关		opposite n.反面 a.相反
研究发现，当受试者处于低压环境时，IQ能预测领导能力，但当处于高压环境下时，IQ测试与领导能力呈负相关－也就是说，根据IQ测试所得的领导能力与实际情况相反。
```



Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it's knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.

```
toil v.(长时间)苦干 辛勤劳作		testify v.证明 	test-talking skill 应试技巧		
matters v.重要 n.事情		guess v.猜想		skip v.跳过
任何熬过学术评估测验的人都可以证明，应试技巧也很重要，无论是知道何时应该猜测或是什么题目应该跳过。
```
