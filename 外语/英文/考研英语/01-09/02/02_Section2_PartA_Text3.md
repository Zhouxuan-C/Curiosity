Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in
the oil price. 



Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy,
energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. 



Software, consultancy and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. 



For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. 



The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil prices averaged \$22a barrel for a full year, compared with$13in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974or 1980. 



On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies—to which heavy industry has shifted — have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed.
