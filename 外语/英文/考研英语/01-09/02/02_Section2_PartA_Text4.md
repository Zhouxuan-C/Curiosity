### Text 4

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for
how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.

```
supreme a.最高的		court n.法院		decision n.决定		physician n.医生	
assist v.协助 		suicide n.自杀	 imply v.暗示		implication n.可能的影响或后果 暗示

suffering 痛苦
最高法院对关于医生协助病人自杀问题的裁决，对于医学界如何设法减轻临终病人的痛苦和折磨来说，具有重大影响
```



Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect”, a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects — a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

```
rule v.裁决		constitution n.宪法		in effect 实际上		support a.支持的	
medical a.医疗的		principle n.原则		effect m.效果 影响		moral a.道德上的	
intend v.打算	意图		harmful a.有害的		foresee v.预见 预知		permissible a.可允许的
尽管它裁定宪法没有赋予医生协助病人自杀的权力，但实际上法院支持 “双重效果” 的医疗原则，这个存在了好几个世纪的道德原则认为，具有双重效果的行为是可允许的 - 希望达到的好效果和可预见的坏效果，只要行为实施者想要的是好效果

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the patient

```
justify v.证明...合理 		doses n.剂量		morphine n.吗啡		terminally ad.晚期的
increasing a.增加的		eventually ad.最终			patient n.病人
近年来，医生们一直用这项原则证明使用大剂量的吗啡来减少晚期患者的痛苦是合理的，即使加大剂量最终会杀死病人
```



Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient medication to control their pain if that might hasten death”.

```
director n.董事		contend v.主张		shield v.保护			insisted 主张
sufficient a.足够的		hasten v.加速
Montefiore 医疗中心主任 Nancy Dubler 主张，这些原则将保护一些医生，这些医生一直到现在还非常、非常强烈地坚称，如果这可能会加速死亡的话，他们不能给病人开足量的药品来控制疼痛
```



George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death.

legitimate a.合情合理的 合法的		medical a.医疗的		purpose n.目的	  patient n.病人

“We don’t call those deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death.

我们不能把那些死亡成为谋杀，因为医生并不是意在杀死病人，尽管他们冒病人死亡的风险。
```



If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their suicide.”

```
如果你是一名医生，可以冒着你的病人自杀的风险，只要你不是意在他们自杀
```



On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.

```
acknowledge v.承认		debate n.争论		fuel v.供以燃料 使争论升温		despair n.绝望
prolong v.延长 拖延		physical a.肉体的 		agony n.极大的痛苦

```



Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life.

```



The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

```

“Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering”, to the extent that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse”. 

```
许多医生对他们的病人正在遭受的不必要的、可预见的痛苦似乎并不关心，甚至到了构成蓄意虐待病人的程度
```

```
他说，行医执照委员会 “必须明确... 痛苦的死亡如果推测是医生处理不当所致，应该吊销行医执照
```
