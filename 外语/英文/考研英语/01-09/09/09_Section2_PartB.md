### Part B



Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. 

```
coinciding with sth 与...同时发生		groundbreaking a.开创性的		theory n.学说
biological a.生物学的		evolution n.进化			proposed v.提出		
naturalist n.博物学家的		philosopher n.哲学家		 put forward 提出		cultural 文化的
在英国博物学家 Charles Darwin 于 19 世纪 60年代提出开创性的生物进化论的同时，应该社会哲学家 Herbert Spencer 也提出了自己的生物和文化进化理论。
```



Spencer argued that all worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward perfection

```
argue v.提出理论(企图)  (坚决)主张		worldly a.尘世的 世事的		phenomenon n.现象
over time 随着时间流逝		advance v.进步		perfection n.完美
Spencer 认为，世间万象，包括人类社会，都随着时间而变化，趋于完善
```



**He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the "survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies.**

```
characterize v.是...的特征			struggle n.斗争		survival n.生存		fit a.适合
weak a.较弱的		race n.种族		eventually ad.最后 最终		
他认为人类进化的特点在于他称为“适者生存”的竞争，在这次竞争中，弱小的种族和社会终将被强大的、更高级的种族和社会替代。
```





American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural evolution in the late 1800s. 

```
introduced v.(初次)提出		
美国社会科学家 Lewis Henry Morgan 在 19 世纪末初次提出了另一种文化进化理论
```



Morgan helped found modem anthropology - the scientific study of human societies, customs and beliefs - thus becoming one of the earliest anthropologists. 

```
found v.建立			anthropology n.人类学		custom n.风俗		belief n.信仰
thus 这样 如此			earliest a.最早的			anthropologists n.人类学家
Morgan 帮助创立了现代人类学 - 对人类社会、习俗和信仰的科学研究 - 因此称为最早的人类学家之一
```



In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies.

```
attempted v.企图		
在他的著作中，他试图说明文化的各个方面是如何在社会的进化过程中共同发生变化的。
```



**Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved.**

```
diverse a.各种各样的		forms n.形式 表格	  category n.类别 种类		kinship n.亲属关系	
ownership n.所有权		property n.财产		evolve v.进化
因此，在他看来，文化的各个方面，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式、亲属分类、财产所有权、政府形式、技术、食品生产体系等，都随着社会的进化而改变。
```





In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism.

```
known a.已知的 有名的	 		historical a.与历史有关的			particularism n.特殊主义
在 20 世纪初的北美，德裔美国人类学家 Franz Boas 提出了一种新的文化理论，被称作“历史特殊论”
```



Historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to anthropology

```
emphasized v.强调			uniqueness n.特殊性		anthropology n.人类学
“历史特殊论” 强调所有文化的特殊性，为人类学指明了新方向
```



**Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism.**

```
innovation n.创新			invention n.发明(物)		pass v.传递		diffusionism n.传播论
其他人类学家认为文化创新，比如发明，具有单一起源，从一个社会传播到另一个社会。这种理论被称为“文化传播论”
```



Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type of culture

```
felt = feel v.认为 感觉			understood = understand			unique a.独一无二的
belong to... 属于...			broad a.广泛的 一般的			stage n.阶段		
Boas 认为，任何社会的文化都必须被理解为某一独一无二的历史，而不是同属于某一更广义的进化阶段或文化类型的许多文化之一
```



**In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, he became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy**

```
in order to 为了... 以便...			particular a.特定的 特殊的 		completely ad.全部地
skill n.技能		linguistics n.语言学的			physical a.身体的		anatomy n.解剖结构
为了尽可能全面地研究特定的文化，他熟练掌握了语言学 (对语言学的研究) 和体质人类学 (对人体生理和解剖结构的研究)
```



Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. 

```
dominant a.占首位的		approach n.方法		largely ad.很大程度上		
在很大程度上，凭借 Boas 众多学生的影响力，“历史特殊论” 成为美国人类学文化研究中居于主导地位的方法，
```



But a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in favor of diffusionism. 

```
reject v.拒绝接受			in favor of 赞同 		
但是 20 世纪初，也有许多人类学家反对文化特殊论，赞同文化传播论
```



Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then spread to other cultures

```
attributed v.把...归因于...			virtually ad.几乎		achievement n.成就	
invention n.发明		gifted  a.有天赋的		people n.民族			spread v.传播		
几乎每个重要的文化成就都归因于少数，尤其是有天赋的名族发明，根据传播论者的看法，这些发明后来传播到了其他文化中
```



For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. 

```
incorrectly 不正确的	suggested a.建议的		inadequate a.不充分的		pottery  n.陶瓷
metallurgy n.冶金		ancient a.古代的		Egypt n.埃及			diffuse v.传播 散布
throughout prep.各处 遍及
比如，英国人类学家 Grafton Elliot Smith 和 W. J. Perry 在信息不充分的基础上错误地指出，农耕、制陶、冶金都源于古埃及，然后散布到全世界。
```



In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world.

```
developments n.发展的产物 成果		occur v.发生		separately ad.单独地		part n.区域
事实上，所有这些文化成果，分别于不同时期在世界多地出现
```



Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist Emile Durkheim developed a theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. 

```
sociologist n.社会学家		greatly 很 非常 极大	
同样在 20 世纪初，法国社会学家 Emile Durkheim 创立了一种对人类学产生极大影响的文化理论。
```



Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity.

```
religious a.宗教的		function v.起作用		reinforce v.加强		solidarity n.团结一致
Durkheim 提出，宗教信仰具有加强社会团结的功能。
```



An interest in the relationship between the function of society and culture became a major theme in European, and especially British, anthropology

```
major a.主要的 		theme n.主题		
社会功能和文化功能之间关联的关注成为欧洲，尤其是美国人类学研究的一大主题。
```



```
[A] Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had
a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as
diffusionism.

[B] In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, he became skilled
in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of
human biology and anatomy.

[C] He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the
"survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually
be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies.

[D] They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social
structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance
into adulthood.

[E] Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families,
forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of
government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as
societies evolved.

[F] Supporters of the theory viewed culture as a collection of integrated parts that
work together to keep a society functioning.

[G] For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry
incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming,
pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused
throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred
separately at different times in many parts of the world.
